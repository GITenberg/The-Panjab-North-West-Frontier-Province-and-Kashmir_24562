description: This book on "The Panjab North-West Frontier Province and Kashmir" by
  Sir James Douie gives his accounts of the physiography, the flora and fauna, the
  people and the administration which are essentially his personal recollections of
  one who has first studied the details as a District Officer and later on corrected
  his perspective, stage by stage, in his higher capacities and finally as officiating
  Lieut. Governor. This book gives an accurate and well proportioned thumbnail sketch
  of North-West India and the profuse illustrations enhance the value of the book.
